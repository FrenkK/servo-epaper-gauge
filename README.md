# servo-epaper-gauge
A simple triple gauge using three servos and a 3-color e-paper display used for indicating a solar system state.
The project includes STEP files for 3d-printing an enclosure and the Arduino code for the ESP32 controller driving the display and servos.
The project uses 3 90g servos to move needles and an e-paper display to display both gauge markings and extra information about the system state.
